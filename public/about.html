<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi,<br/>
  I'm Arijit Chakraborty, born and brought up in kolkata, West Bengal, India.<br/>
  Always I had interest in making web pages but due to some family and financial restrictions,
  was unable to get admission in a technical graduate degree course.
</p>

<p>Started my carrier as a customer service associate.<br/>
  I have worked with 2 companies: Concentrix and Amazon in my customer service journey.
  After working 3 years in this domain finally I was able to manage my financial issues and got chance to learn Web Development.
  Still learning and will learn better in future as there is no end of learning.
</p>

<p>As everyone says no one is late, so I am now into the Web Development and trying to be better and make things better day by day.
  I hope in future my works will be recognised by big compannies.
That is all about me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading my story.</p>
